  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly
    toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
    flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh italian parsley</li>
    <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
  </ul>
