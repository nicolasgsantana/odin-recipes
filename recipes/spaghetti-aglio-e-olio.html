  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly
    toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
    flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
